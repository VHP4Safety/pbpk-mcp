# rxode2 Adapter Workflow

For the broader product architecture and rollout plan, see:

- `docs/architecture/dual_backend_pbpk_mcp.md`
- `docs/deployment/rxode2_worker_image.md`

This workspace now includes a hybrid subprocess bridge that can handle both:

- OSPSuite simulation transfer files (`.pkml`)
- `rxode2` model modules (`.R`)

The `rxode2` path is a direct execution backend for PBPK models authored natively in R. It is not restricted to models converted from Berkeley Madonna.

## Files added for the rxode2 path

- `scripts/ospsuite_bridge.R`
  - Hybrid bridge process used by the Python adapter.
- `cisplatin_models/cisplatin_population_rxode2_model.R`
  - MCP-friendly cisplatin `rxode2` model module.
- `patches/mcp_bridge/adapter/ospsuite.py`
  - Patched subprocess adapter with `.R` support and population result persistence.
- `src/mcp/tools/load_simulation.py`
  - Patched tool validation so `.R` model modules are accepted.
- `scripts/apply_rxode2_patch.py`
  - Copies the patched files into the live PBPK MCP container.

## Expected rxode2 model-module contract

Each model file loaded through the bridge should define:

- `pbpk_model_metadata()`
- `pbpk_model_profile()`
- `pbpk_parameter_catalog()`
- `pbpk_default_parameters()`
- `pbpk_run_simulation(parameters, simulation_id = NULL, run_id = NULL, request = list())`
- `pbpk_run_population(parameters, cohort = list(), outputs = list(), simulation_id = NULL, request = list())`

Optional guardrail hooks:

- `pbpk_supported_outputs()`
- `pbpk_capabilities()`
- `pbpk_validate_request(request = list(), parameters = NULL, stage = NULL, ...)`
- `pbpk_parameter_table(parameters = NULL, parameter_catalog = NULL, ...)`
- `pbpk_performance_evidence(...)`
- `pbpk_uncertainty_evidence(...)`
- `pbpk_verification_evidence(...)`
- `pbpk_run_verification_checks(...)`
- `pbpk_platform_qualification_evidence(...)`

When present, the evidence hooks receive the loaded runtime parameter state and a parameter-table snapshot from the bridge. This lets an `rxode2` model export uncertainty or performance evidence that reflects the current MCP session rather than only a static default manifest.

The bridge keeps parameter editing generic, so parameter values are stored by path in the bridge and passed into the model functions as a named list.

If `pbpk_capabilities()` is present, its payload is surfaced through `load_simulation`.
If `pbpk_model_profile()` is present, `load_simulation` also returns a `profile` block with OECD-style scientific metadata such as:

- `contextOfUse`
- `applicabilityDomain`
- `modelPerformance`
- `parameterProvenance`
- `uncertainty`
- `implementationVerification`
- `platformQualification`
- `peerReview`

`peerReview` can now carry structured traceability fields such as:

- `reviewRecords`
- `priorRegulatoryUse`
- `revisionStatus`
- `revisionHistory`

When these are present, the bridge exposes additive coverage counters in the normalized profile so downstream dossier tooling can distinguish declared peer engagement from prior-use and revision traceability.

`modelPerformance` can now also carry richer traceability fields such as:

- `goodnessOfFit.datasetRecords`
- `predictiveChecks.datasetRecords`
- `evaluationData.datasetRecords`
- `goodnessOfFit.acceptanceCriteria`
- `predictiveChecks.acceptanceCriteria`

When these are present, the bridge exposes additive coverage counters in the normalized profile and in `performanceEvidence.traceability`, so predictive-support metadata is not reduced to a single `status` field.

If `pbpk_validate_request()` is present, the bridge calls it during:

- `load_simulation`
- `set_parameter_value`
- `run_simulation`
- `run_population_simulation`

Validation errors are returned before execution as adapter `InteropError`s with the normalized field-level messages from the model hook.

Current convention:

- `capabilities` reports operational MCP behavior
- `profile` reports scientific/context-of-use metadata
- `validation.assessment` explains whether the request is only inside runtime guardrails or actually backed by stronger qualification evidence
- `validation.assessment.qualificationState` derives an explicit qualification label such as `exploratory`, `research-use`, `regulatory-candidate`, or `qualified-within-context`

Current MCP surfaces that use this data:

- `validate_model_manifest`
  - runs a static pre-load manifest inspection for a supported `.R` file
- `load_simulation`
  - returns `capabilities`, `profile`, and the default `validation` payload for the loaded model
- `validate_simulation_request`
  - runs preflight validation without triggering execution
- `run_verification_checks`
  - runs executable verification checks and returns structured check results, smoke artifact handles, parameter-unit consistency, structural flow/volume consistency, deterministic integrity/reproducibility summaries, optional model-specific checks such as mass balance or solver stability, and a compact verification-evidence snapshot
- `export_oecd_report`
  - returns a structured dossier/report with `qualificationState`, `profile`, `validation`, `oecdChecklist`, `performanceEvidence`, `uncertaintyEvidence`, `verificationEvidence`, `executableVerification`, `platformQualificationEvidence`, and an optional parameter table
  - `parameterTable` now also carries `coverage`, `issues`, `bundleMetadata`, and merged-source provenance so dossier completeness around units, citations, distributions, study conditions, and rationale is visible directly in the MCP payload
  - if a model author prefers file-based attachment over a code hook, companion bundles such as `model.parameters.json` are also supported; see [parameter_table_bundles.md](/Volumes/Storage/topotox_offload/20260220_space_relief/manual_offload/PBPK_MCP/docs/integration_guides/parameter_table_bundles.md)
  - `performanceEvidence` now carries explicit classification fields such as `strongestEvidenceClass`, `qualificationBoundary`, and support flags for observed-versus-predicted, predictive-dataset, and external-qualification evidence so runtime smoke checks are not overstated
  - `performanceEvidence.traceability` now reports whether structured dataset records and explicit acceptance criteria were actually declared, even when the bundled evidence remains internal or limited
  - if a model author prefers file-based attachment over a code hook, companion bundles such as `model.performance.json` are also supported; see [performance_evidence_bundles.md](/Volumes/Storage/topotox_offload/20260220_space_relief/manual_offload/PBPK_MCP/docs/integration_guides/performance_evidence_bundles.md)
  - `executableVerification` is included when `run_verification_checks` has already been executed for that loaded simulation; export does not rerun verification implicitly
  - `uncertaintyEvidence` can include bounded local sensitivity rows and compact variability-propagation summaries for models that choose to export them, but those rows should still be documented as internal quantitative evidence rather than global uncertainty analysis
  - if a model author prefers file-based attachment over a code hook, companion bundles such as `model.uncertainty.json` are also supported; see [uncertainty_evidence_bundles.md](/Volumes/Storage/topotox_offload/20260220_space_relief/manual_offload/PBPK_MCP/docs/integration_guides/uncertainty_evidence_bundles.md)
  - `peerReviewAndPriorUse` now becomes stronger only when structured peer-review records, prior-use traceability, and revision-history details are actually declared; a free-text review summary alone remains partial evidence
- `run_simulation` / `get_results`
  - preserve the validation assessment on deterministic result metadata

## Applying the patch

Patch the live worker container:

```bash
python scripts/apply_rxode2_patch.py --container pbpk_mcp-worker-1
```

Patch and restart a container:

```bash
python scripts/apply_rxode2_patch.py --container pbpk_mcp-worker-1 --restart
```

If an API container exists separately, patch that container too.

Recommended long-term path:

- use `scripts/apply_rxode2_patch.py` for development patching only
- use the prebuilt worker image from `docker/rxode2-worker.Dockerfile` for normal deployment

## Model path to use

After patching, the cisplatin model is copied to:

```text
/app/var/models/rxode2/cisplatin/cisplatin_population_rxode2_model.R
```

## Example MCP calls

Load the model:

```json
{
  "tool": "load_simulation",
  "arguments": {
    "filePath": "/app/var/models/rxode2/cisplatin/cisplatin_population_rxode2_model.R",
    "simulationId": "cisplatin-rxode2"
  }
}
```

Example shape of the enriched load response:

```json
{
  "simulationId": "cisplatin-rxode2",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "Cisplatin population kidney model",
    "modelVersion": "2026-03-17-rxode2",
    "createdBy": "Codex",
    "backend": "rxode2"
  },
  "capabilities": {
    "populationSimulation": true,
    "validationHook": true,
    "scientificProfile": true,
    "supportedOutputs": [
      "Plasma|Cisplatin|Concentration"
    ],
    "applicabilityDomain": {
      "type": "declared-with-runtime-guardrails",
      "qualificationLevel": "research-use"
    }
  },
  "profile": {
    "contextOfUse": {
      "regulatoryUse": "research-only"
    },
    "uncertainty": {
      "status": "partially-characterized"
    },
    "implementationVerification": {
      "status": "basic-internal-checks"
    }
  },
  "validation": {
    "ok": true,
    "assessment": {
      "decision": "within-declared-guardrails",
      "qualificationLevel": "research-use",
      "oecdChecklistScore": 0.8
    }
  },
  "warnings": [
    "Applicability checks currently reflect runtime guardrails for this implementation, not external scientific qualification.",
    "Declared context of use is research-only; regulatory or cross-domain use requires additional qualification evidence."
  ]
}
```

The `validation.assessment` payload now also includes:

- `qualificationState`
  - derived qualification label and readiness summary
- `oecdChecklist`
  - structured per-dimension OECD-style metadata coverage
- `oecdChecklistScore`
  - a normalized completeness score derived from the checklist dimensions

Run a deterministic simulation:

```json
{
  "tool": "run_simulation",
  "arguments": {
    "simulationId": "cisplatin-rxode2",
    "runId": "cisplatin-demo"
  }
}
```

Run a population simulation:

```json
{
  "tool": "run_population_simulation",
  "arguments": {
    "modelPath": "/app/var/models/rxode2/cisplatin/cisplatin_population_rxode2_model.R",
    "simulationId": "cisplatin-rxode2",
    "cohort": {
      "size": 50,
      "seed": 42
    },
    "outputs": {
      "aggregates": ["meanCmax", "sdCmax", "meanAUC", "sdAUC"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Runtime prerequisite

The container still needs the R package `rxode2` installed. The patch script verifies syntax and reports whether `rxode2` is available, but it does not install R packages.

Preferred approach:

- build a dedicated `rxode2` worker image once
- keep runtime workers capped conservatively after the image is built
