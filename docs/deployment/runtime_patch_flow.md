# Runtime Deployment Flow

## Purpose

The local PBPK MCP stack now has two explicit operator modes:

- a packaged local runtime used by default
- an opt-in source-overlay development runtime for workspace iteration

In both modes, the authoritative contract comes from:

- the packaged `src/` implementation in the image
- the worker-image baseline assets baked by `docker/rxode2-worker.Dockerfile`
- the published packaged contract artifacts exposed through `mcp_bridge.contract`

Only the explicit source-overlay profile additionally uses:

- the workspace `src/` tree bind-mounted at `/app/src`
- `scripts/runtime_src_overlay.pth`, which promotes `/app/src` ahead of the installed package when `PBPK_ENABLE_SRC_OVERLAY=true`

This document explains both local deployment modes and how to operate them safely.

## Why This Exists

The `0.4.x` line is reducing the old patch-first debt without breaking the live contract.

At the current stage:

- the user-facing and tested MCP contract is real
- the generic runtime now lives in packaged `src/`
- the worker image bakes the baseline R assets directly
- the default local compose stack now runs the packaged baseline directly
- an explicit overlay profile still exists for maintainer-local workspace iteration

This is still a transitional operator model, but it is materially simpler than the earlier hot-patch flow and now cleaner than the old overlay-by-default setup.

## Canonical Files

The local deployment surface is defined by:

- `docker-compose.celery.yml`
- `docker-compose.overlay.yml`
- `docker-compose.hardened.yml`
- `scripts/deploy_rxode2_stack.sh`
- `scripts/deploy_source_overlay_stack.sh`
- `scripts/deploy_hardened_stack.sh`
- `scripts/wait_for_runtime_ready.py`
- `scripts/runtime_src_overlay.pth`
- `docker/rxode2-worker.Dockerfile`

The worker image now bakes:

- `src/` at `/app/src`
- `scripts/runtime_src_overlay.pth`
- `scripts/ospsuite_bridge.R`
- `reference_models/reference_compound_population_rxode2_model.R`

The default packaged compose stack bind-mounts:

- `./var:/app/var`

The optional source-overlay profile additionally bind-mounts:

- `./src:/app/src`
- `./scripts:/app/scripts`
- `./scripts/runtime_src_overlay.pth:/usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pbpk_mcp_runtime_src.pth:ro`

The live schema, capability-matrix, and contract-manifest resources now treat packaged `mcp_bridge.contract` content as authoritative. `scripts/check_installed_package_contract.py` is the maintainer gate that proves the generated package fallback still matches the published JSON artifacts after a non-editable local install.

## Operator Entry Points

Use these in order of preference.

### 1. Default packaged local redeploy

```bash
./scripts/deploy_rxode2_stack.sh
```

Use this when:

- you want the local stack to reflect the current packaged worker-image baseline
- you want the default operator path rather than maintainer-local source overrides
- you recreated the containers and want the live MCP surface to stay aligned

What it does:

- recreates `redis`, `api`, and `worker`
- keeps the local `var/` bind mount in place for models, jobs, and smoke artifacts
- waits for stable `/health` and `/mcp/list_tools` responses before returning so follow-on live checks do not race a still-settling API process

### 2. Source-overlay maintainer redeploy

```bash
./scripts/deploy_source_overlay_stack.sh
```

Use this when:

- you changed workspace `src/` or runtime helper files
- you want the running API and worker to reflect the current workspace tree rather than only the baked image
- you are doing maintainer-local development on the runtime itself

What it does:

- layers `docker-compose.overlay.yml` over `docker-compose.celery.yml`
- bind-mounts the local `src/`, `scripts/`, and `var/` trees
- enables `PBPK_ENABLE_SRC_OVERLAY=true`
- waits for stable `/health` and `/mcp/list_tools` responses before returning

### 3. Hardened local or operator redeploy

```bash
AUTH_ISSUER_URL="https://issuer.example" \
AUTH_AUDIENCE="pbpk-mcp" \
AUTH_JWKS_URL="https://issuer.example/.well-known/jwks.json" \
./scripts/deploy_hardened_stack.sh
```

Use this when:

- you want the same local runtime contract with stricter auth defaults
- you are testing a non-anonymous deployment posture locally
- you want the API port bound through `PBPK_BIND_HOST` / `PBPK_BIND_PORT` instead of the base compose defaults

What it does:

- layers `docker-compose.hardened.yml` over `docker-compose.celery.yml`
- requires explicit auth settings before compose startup will succeed
- sets `AUTH_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=false` and `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- waits for stable `/health` and `/mcp/list_tools` responses at the configured bind host/port before returning

### 4. Rebuild the worker image baseline

```bash
./scripts/build_rxode2_worker_image.sh
```

Use this when:

- the baked baseline image itself should change
- `rxode2` or image-baked runtime assets need to be updated
- you want the image baseline to catch up with the current packaged runtime

This does not replace the local runtime flows. It updates the baseline image that both the packaged and source-overlay modes build on top of.

## Verification Workflow

After deploy:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/list_tools
python3 scripts/release_readiness_check.py
python3 scripts/workspace_model_smoke.py --auth-dev-secret pbpk-local-dev-secret
make misuse-prevention-live-test PY=python3
```

These checks should confirm:

- the live version marker is correct
- the documented tool surface is present
- the bundled curated example models still pass the strict manifest publication gate with explicit NGRA boundaries
- discovery, validation, deterministic results, and OECD report export still work
- `.pksim5` rejection still carries explicit conversion guidance
- the currently discovered runtime-supported models still load and execute through the live API
- the named live misuse-prevention suite still proves the running server enforces the current trust-surface, sign-off, and security posture

`./scripts/deploy_rxode2_stack.sh` includes a built-in readiness wait through `scripts/wait_for_runtime_ready.py`. That helper requires several consecutive successful `/health` and `/mcp/list_tools` probes before the deploy command exits, which reduces transient connection resets immediately after container recreate.

`./scripts/deploy_hardened_stack.sh` uses the same readiness helper, but targets the base URL derived from `PBPK_BIND_HOST` and `PBPK_BIND_PORT`. This lets the hardened profile validate the same runtime contract without assuming the default `127.0.0.1:8000` bind target.

When you specifically want to exercise declared `rxode2` population support too, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/workspace_model_smoke.py --include-population --auth-dev-secret pbpk-local-dev-secret
```

This emits `var/workspace_model_smoke_report.json` and gives you a catalog-wide view of:

- manifest state
- qualification state
- deterministic execution status
- stored result retrieval
- optional population smoke status

In the GitHub repository, the same smoke path should be treated as a release-grade verification step rather than a lightweight PR check. The recommended automation split is:

- lightweight CI for contract and packaging checks
- separate model-smoke workflow for Docker-backed live execution and uploaded smoke artifacts

## Failure Modes To Watch

### Container recreate is serving stale behavior

Symptom:

- `/mcp/list_tools` or `/mcp/resources/contract-manifest` does not reflect the current workspace state

Typical cause:

- the wrong deployment mode is still running
- the wrong compose project or stale container is still running

Fix:

- rerun `./scripts/deploy_rxode2_stack.sh`
- verify `/health` and `/mcp/list_tools` again

### Image baseline and source overlay diverged

Symptom:

- the local stack works, but a clean image-based run does not

Typical cause:

- the explicit source-overlay profile is masking an out-of-date worker image baseline

Fix:

- rebuild with `./scripts/build_rxode2_worker_image.sh`
- rerun `./scripts/deploy_rxode2_stack.sh`
- rerun `python3 scripts/release_readiness_check.py`

### Runtime format policy drift

Symptom:

- `.pksim5` or `.mmd` starts loading with inconsistent behavior

Fix:

- verify `src/mcp/tools/load_simulation.py`
- rerun `python3 scripts/release_readiness_check.py`
- rerun `python3 scripts/workspace_model_smoke.py --auth-dev-secret pbpk-local-dev-secret`

### Hardened overlay fails before startup

Symptom:

- `docker compose` aborts immediately when using `docker-compose.hardened.yml`

Typical cause:

- one or more required auth variables are unset:
  - `AUTH_ISSUER_URL`
  - `AUTH_AUDIENCE`
  - `AUTH_JWKS_URL`

Fix:

- export the required variables
- optionally set `PBPK_BIND_HOST` / `PBPK_BIND_PORT`
- rerun `./scripts/deploy_hardened_stack.sh`

## Deferred Work

The next packaging milestone should keep reducing the remaining local overlay-specific maintainership surface until even the explicit source-overlay profile is thinner.

For now:

- the packaged local runtime is the default operator path
- the source-overlay profile is the supported maintainership path when you are actively changing runtime code
