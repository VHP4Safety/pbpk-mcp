## Unreleased

### Added

- structured `uncertaintyEvidence` and `verificationEvidence` export in the OECD report path
- structured `platformQualificationEvidence` export in the OECD report path
- optional `pbpk_uncertainty_evidence(...)`, `pbpk_verification_evidence(...)`, and `pbpk_platform_qualification_evidence(...)` hooks for MCP-ready `rxode2` models
- `scripts/workspace_model_smoke.py` for discovery-first, catalog-wide runtime smoke checks across the live API
- a converged `run_population_simulation` patch tool that uses loaded `simulationId` sessions and treats `modelPath` as legacy-only compatibility
- `run_verification_checks` for executable smoke-oriented verification across loaded `ospsuite` and `rxode2` models
- deterministic result-integrity and repeat-run reproducibility checks in the executable verification path
- optional `pbpk_run_verification_checks(...)` hooks for model-specific executable qualification checks such as mass balance and solver-stability heuristics
- stored `executableVerification` snapshots in `export_oecd_report` so OECD dossiers can carry the latest executed verification results without implicitly rerunning them
- parameter-catalog and parameter-table snapshots are now passed into `pbpk_run_verification_checks(...)` so model-specific runtime checks can validate exposed units and structural coverage
- executable structural physiology checks for systemic flow distribution and renal volume partition consistency in the cisplatin example model
- bounded local sensitivity evidence for the cisplatin example, exported through `uncertaintyEvidence` with current-parameter context rather than a placeholder sensitivity gap
- bounded variability-propagation evidence for the cisplatin example, exported through `uncertaintyEvidence` as a compact internal-exposure distribution summary
- explicit performance-evidence classification and qualification-boundary summaries in `export_oecd_report`, so runtime smoke/internal evidence is separated from predictive and external qualification evidence
- generic companion performance-evidence bundles for `.pkml` and MCP-ready `.R` models via files such as `model.performance.json`
- reusable starter template for companion performance-evidence bundles at `examples/performance_evidence_bundle.template.json`
- generic companion uncertainty-evidence bundles for `.pkml` and MCP-ready `.R` models via files such as `model.uncertainty.json`
- reusable starter template for companion uncertainty-evidence bundles at `examples/uncertainty_evidence_bundle.template.json`

### Changed

- static manifest inspection now detects uncertainty, verification, and platform-qualification evidence hooks on R models
- README and integration guides now document the richer OECD evidence export surface
- live regression checks now assert the `run_population_simulation` contract no longer requires `modelPath`
- maintainer documentation now treats workspace-model smoke as a first-class verification step for release hygiene
- release-readiness checks now exercise the executable verification surface in addition to validation, execution, and OECD report export
- executable verification now goes beyond smoke-only checks by asserting deterministic result integrity and repeat-run reproducibility
- OECD checklist/report generation now separates software-platform qualification evidence from implementation verification evidence
- the cisplatin example now contributes executable mass-balance and solver-stability checks through the runtime verification hook
- OECD report export now carries stored executable verification snapshots separately from static `verificationEvidence`
- the cisplatin example now contributes executable parameter-unit consistency checks through the runtime verification hook
- the cisplatin example now contributes executable systemic-flow and renal-volume consistency checks through the runtime verification hook
- bridge evidence hooks now receive the loaded runtime parameter context and parameter-table snapshot so uncertainty/performance evidence can reflect the actual loaded model state
- cisplatin runtime smoke evidence is now explicitly labeled as internal operational evidence rather than implied predictive support
- static manifest inspection now treats a companion performance-evidence bundle as a valid alternative to a dedicated `pbpk_performance_evidence(...)` hook for `R` models
- companion performance-evidence bundles can now expose bundle-level metadata, and that metadata is surfaced through static manifest inspection and OECD report export
- malformed performance-evidence rows are now surfaced as warnings during static manifest inspection and OECD report export instead of being silently normalized
- static manifest inspection now treats a companion uncertainty-evidence bundle as a valid alternative to a dedicated `pbpk_uncertainty_evidence(...)` hook for `R` models
- companion uncertainty-evidence bundles can now expose bundle-level metadata, and that metadata is surfaced through static manifest inspection and OECD report export
- malformed uncertainty-evidence rows are now surfaced as warnings during static manifest inspection and OECD report export instead of being silently normalized

## v0.3.0 - 2026-03-20

### Added

- shared runtime patch manifest and installer so the Docker image build and hot-patch workflow use the same file map
- release-readiness checks for tool-catalog exposure, discovery/resource parity, and explicit `.pksim5` rejection guidance
- load-policy contract tests covering conversion-only format messaging

### Changed

- made the patch-first runtime layer explicit as the canonical implementation surface for this convergence stage
- updated `scripts/deploy_rxode2_stack.sh` to recreate the stack and immediately reapply the current workspace patch set
- changed `scripts/apply_rxode2_patch.py` to patch both API and worker containers by default
- tightened direct `.pksim5` and `.mmd` rejection messages so conversion guidance is explicit and consistent with the published architecture

### Notes

- `v0.3.0` is the contract-convergence milestone for the current patch-first PBPK MCP runtime
- packaging migration into a pure `src/` implementation is intentionally deferred to a later stage

## v0.2.4 - 2026-03-19

### Added

- `validate_model_manifest` for static pre-load qualification and completeness checks on supported `.pkml` and MCP-ready `.R` models
- explicit `qualificationState` classification in validation responses and OECD dossier exports
- `scripts/validate_model_manifests.py` for release-gating and batch manifest checks across model inventories

### Changed

- extended the OECD-oriented bridge layer to derive reusable qualification-state labels instead of only checklist and readiness summaries
- tightened publication and release-readiness guidance around model manifest completeness and qualification metadata coverage

### Notes

- `v0.2.4` extends the OECD-oriented qualification workflow with reusable qualification states and pre-load manifest validation

## v0.2.3 - 2026-03-19

### Changed

- aligned repository version markers so `README`, package metadata, OpenAPI docs, and compose/runtime surfaces consistently reflect the latest patch release
- moved the post-`v0.2.2` version-alignment follow-up into an explicit release instead of leaving it only on `main`

### Notes

- `v0.2.3` is a release-alignment patch over `v0.2.2`
- it does not change the MCP tool surface or PBPK runtime behavior

## v0.2.2 - 2026-03-19

### Added

- `export_oecd_report` for structured OECD-style dossier export across supported backends
- `modelPerformance`, `parameterProvenance`, and `performanceEvidence` support in the qualification/reporting layer
- `pbpk_parameter_table(...)` and `pbpk_performance_evidence(...)` support in the R model-module contract
- `scripts/release_readiness_check.py` for pre-release validation against the running local stack
- expanded architecture documentation with logical and runtime Mermaid diagrams

### Changed

- made the architecture documentation reflect the current implemented dual-backend design rather than a purely proposed target
- tightened qualification wording so runtime or smoke evidence is not presented as full predictivity evidence
- expanded public limitations documentation around format support, qualification boundaries, and worker/runtime constraints

### Fixed

- preserved sidecar-backed profile provenance cleanly in exported OECD reports
- aligned release documentation with the current OECD reporting and performance-evidence surfaces

## v0.2.1 - 2026-03-19

### Added

- cleaner GitHub-facing README structure with a repaired Mermaid architecture diagram
- refreshed public release notes and publication-oriented documentation surfaces

### Changed

- aligned package, compose, and metadata surfaces to `v0.2.1`
- clarified project positioning around accessibility, OECD orientation, and direct `rxode2` execution

### Notes

- `v0.2.1` was primarily a documentation and release-surface cleanup over `v0.2.0`

## v0.2.0 - 2026-03-18

### Added

- dual-backend execution model with `ospsuite` for `.pkml` and `rxode2` for MCP-ready `.R`
- filesystem-backed model discovery through `discover_models` and `/mcp/resources/models`
- OECD-oriented `profile` metadata and `validate_simulation_request` preflight assessment
- structured `oecdChecklist` and `oecdChecklistScore` in validation assessments
- sidecar-backed scientific metadata for OSPSuite models
- `rxode2` population simulation support through the dedicated worker image
- stable enhanced MCP response contract with `tool` and `contractVersion`
- GitHub-facing README architecture diagram and limitations documentation

### Changed

- clarified that `rxode2` is a first-class execution backend, not only a conversion target
- flattened async job-status fields for easier client chaining
- separated discoverable model files from loaded simulation sessions
- exposed host API port `8000` in the local Celery deployment
- bumped `SERVICE_VERSION` in `docker-compose.celery.yml` to `0.2.0`

### Fixed

- `.pkml` runtime execution for transfer files with empty `OutputSelections` via bounded observer fallback
- live discovery/index mismatch where custom models like cisplatin were loadable but not discoverable
- validation edge cases around scalar `contextOfUse` values
- async deterministic result retrieval with persisted fallback in `get_results`

### Notes

- Berkeley Madonna `.mmd` remains a conversion source, not a direct runtime format
- many included scientific profiles are still `illustrative-example` or `research-use`, not regulatory-ready
